# 👋 Hey, I’m Adam Upholzer

🚀 **Sales Execution Manager @ AT&T**  
📊 **Analytics, Automation & Infrastructure Builder**  
🌐 **Cloud • Networking • Data • Apple Ecosystem**

I build **systems that scale**, automate the boring stuff, and turn messy data into clear decisions.  
My work sits at the intersection of **business execution**, **data analytics**, and **modern infrastructure** — both professionally and in my own projects.

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On

- **Sales & Business Intelligence**
  - Power BI dashboards, semantic models, star schemas
  - Automated reporting pipelines & executive-ready insights
  - Turning operational noise into actionable signals

- **Infrastructure & Networking**
  - UniFi (VLANs, firewall zones, traffic segmentation)
  - Cloudflare (Zero Trust, Tunnels, Workers, DNS, Access)
  - Security-first, privacy-centric home & business networks

- **Automation & DevOps**
  - GitHub Actions, CI/CD, environment-driven config
  - n8n workflows & event-based automations
  - Terraform-style infrastructure thinking (even when not using Terraform)

- **Apple-Centric Power Workflows**
  - iCloud Drive + Finder tags + Shortcuts
  - Apple Intelligence–assisted document classification
  - SwiftUI & document-based app experimentation

## 🧭 How I Think

- Systems > tools  
- Automation before repetition  
- Security and privacy are defaults, not add-ons  
- Documentation is part of the build  
- If it can be modeled, it can be automated
