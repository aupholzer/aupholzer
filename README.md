# Adam Upholzer  
### Data Engineering • Agentic Automation • Microsoft Ecosystem Consulting

I help organizations **transform raw, fragmented data into standardized, actionable intelligence** using Microsoft’s **Common Data Model (CDM)** — then operationalize that data with **custom Copilot agents and agentic workers** that automate real business processes.

My work focuses on **making systems think and act**, not just report.

## What Clients Hire Me For

### 🧱 Data Engineering & Standardization
- Transforming disparate source data into **Microsoft Common Data Model–aligned schemas**
- Designing clean, reusable semantic layers for analytics and automation
- Data shaping for Power Platform, Copilot, and downstream agents
- Eliminating “spreadsheet glue” and brittle manual transformations

### 🤖 Copilot Agents & Agentic Workers
- Custom Copilot agents tailored to specific business functions
- Agentic workers that:
  - Monitor systems
  - Take actions
  - Trigger workflows
  - Communicate outcomes automatically
- AI agents that **do the work**, not just answer questions

### ⚙️ Business Automation (Microsoft Power Platform)
- Power Automate flows for operational processes
- Event-driven automations triggered by data changes
- Integration-first designs that scale beyond single workflows
- Automation patterns designed to survive org and tool changes

### ☎️ Communications & Voice Automation
- **[RingCentral] Ignite Partner**
- Full RingCentral lifecycle management:
  - Deployments
  - Migrations
  - Number porting
  - Ongoing optimization
- Custom RingCentral API integrations to:
  - Enrich call data
  - Trigger workflows
  - Automate post-call actions
  - Tie voice activity directly into business systems

### 💬 Teams-Centric Operations
- Microsoft Teams as an **operational command surface**
- Bots and workflows that surface data where people already work
- Automated notifications, approvals, and actions inside Teams
- Reducing context-switching across tools

## How I Think About Systems

- **Data first** — automation is only as good as the data model
- **Standardize early** — CDM alignment unlocks scale
- **Agents over dashboards** — insight without action is waste
- **Integrate, don’t duct-tape** — APIs beat exports every time
- **Operational intelligence > reporting**

I’m often brought in when:
- Data exists but isn’t usable across systems
- Reporting works, but operations are still manual
- Copilot is enabled but underperforming
- Phone systems generate data that goes unused
- Teams is chat-heavy but operationally passive
